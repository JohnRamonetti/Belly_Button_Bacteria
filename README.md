# Belly_Button_Bacteria
Module 12 - Plotly


## OVERVIEW
### Purpose - The purpose of the current endeavor was to create a web-format visualization of the results of research into bacterial colonies found on the human body that may be useful.  Specifically, samples of bacteria were taken from the navels of several volunteers.  Some of these bacteria are suspected of being able to produce proteins that have a taste similar to beef.  The big questions is "Can they be used to create a beef substitue?" The numbers and varieties of bacteria found for each individual are shown in visualizations, including a summary of the individual demographics, along with a bar chart, bubble chart and gauge chart.  The charts, which are interactive and can be searched by individual volunteer number, can be seen at https://johnramonetti.github.io/Belly_Button_Bacteria/

## RESOURCES
  - Source Files:  samples.json
  - Software:  Javascript, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Plotly

## RESULTS
### As noted above, the completed results can be viewed at https://johnramonetti.github.io/Belly_Button_Bacteria/.  
### The results include:
  1. Table of demographic information for the individual selected.
  2. A horizontal bar chart showing the ten(10) most numerous bacteria found in the individual's navel.
  3. A bubble chart showing all of the varieties of bacteria, and their respective quantities found for the individual.
  4. A gauge chart which shows the average number of times weekly that the individual reports to bathe (i.e., clean their navel).
 
### The results are searchable.  Simply select a volunteer number from the drop-down menu and all charts/information will be updated to reflect the new volunteer selection.
